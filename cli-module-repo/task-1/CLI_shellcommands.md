### Zsh

Zsh (Z shell) incorporates features from other shells like Bash, ksh, and tcsh. It offers advanced tab-completion, spelling correction, and theming capabilities. 

### Oh-My-Zsh

Oh-My-Zsh is a popular framework for managing the Zsh shell. It comes with a vast collection of plugins and themes and easy to instal land configure.

###  Powershell

PowerShell is a powerful, cross-platform and modern command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. It combines a command-line interface with scripting capabilities, allowing users to automate tasks and manage system configurations.

### Fish

Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell) is designed to be user-friendly and interactive. It has a user-friendly syntax highlighting, auto-suggestions, and a simple scripting language. 

### Dash

Dash is a lightweight and fast shell, primarily used in scripting and as the default system shell on some Unix-like operating systems. It is designed to be efficient and is often used for system scripts and scripts requiring high performance.

## Bash Commands

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) comes with some commands to interact with your computer. You can view and move between directories (cd, ls, mv, cp, rm, mkdir), create, view, and edit text files (touch, cat, less, more), and compile/source config files (for example, source ~/.zshrc).

### Text manipulation with sed and awk

- **sed**: Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
- **awk**: A versatile programming language mainly used for pattern scanning and text extraction.

### File search with grep

- **grep**: A powerful search utility that searches for patterns in files and outputs lines that match the pattern.

### Compare two files using diff and comm

- **diff**: Compares two files line by line and displays the differences.
- **comm**: Compares two sorted files line by line and displays lines that are unique or common.

### Redirect input and output using >, >> and |

- `>`: Redirects output to a file, overwriting the file if it exists.
- `>>`: Redirects output to a file, appending to the file if it exists.
- `|`: Redirects the output of one command as the input to another command (pipe).

## Bash Tasks

Performing various tasks efficiently in Bash involves mastering key tasks and commands. Here are some essential Bash tasks:

### Set and use an environmental variable

- **`export`**: Sets an environment variable that can be accessed by child processes.
- **`$VARIABLE_NAME`**: Accesses the value of an environment variable.

### Utilize the command history effectively

- **`history`**: Displays a list of previously executed commands.
- **`!n`**: Re-executes the nth command from the history.

### Monitor system processes using commands like ps

- **`ps`**: Displays information about active processes.
- **`ps aux`**: Provides a detailed list of all processes.

### Remotely connect to another machine using ssh

- **`ssh`**: Connects to a remote machine securely using the SSH protocol.
- Example: `ssh username@remote_ip`

### Monitor system health with top or htop

- **`top`**: Displays a dynamic real-time view of system processes.
- **`htop`**: An enhanced version of `top` with a more user-friendly interface and additional features.
